Code currently: #A mock text battle system that will eventually evolve into a modern RPG
All other detail stuff and data necessary to plan for this

Current objectives to get a working demo:

I. Finish sorting out enemy types
II. Finishing getting a baseline for the battle system
III. Ironing out unique abilities and items
